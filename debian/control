Description: Qt5 theme integration for Deepin application
 Deepin's qt5integration provides library plugins used by Deepin
 application and Deepin Desktop Environment. It implements many extra
 features on top of stock Qt, include hijacking window decoration /
 shadow painting, better support for cursors under HiDPI, retrieval of
 full list of windows under current workspace, support for window of
 arbitrary shape with anti-aliasing and so on, to make Qt5 application
 and Deepin Desktop Environment more user-friendly.
 .
 This package is part of DDE (Deepin Desktop Environment).
